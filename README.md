# BrewGeany
BrewGeany is free software to help you manage the brew process. It is written in Python3. I use Python3, because Python3 will be the future version.

BrewGeany is an attempt to ake brew software like brewgear or brouwhulp. I usually use brouwhulp, which is a Dutch program written in Free Pascal. Brouwhulp has some major drawbacks: It does not run on Apple OS, Screens are not scaleable, its interface is in Dutch.

Using Python makes it possible to use it on allmost any platform.
